# odd_sdlc TypeScript Install And Release Adapters

**Status**: Active
**Owner Ticket**: `.ai-workspace/tickets/completed/T-059-realize-typescript-install-normalize-and-release-cut-adapters.md`
**Implements**: `REQ-F-ODDSDLC-040`, `REQ-F-ODDSDLC-043`

## Position

This design owns the bounded side-effect adapters required before
`odd_sdlc.TS` can be evaluated as a full operational RC candidate.

The adapters do not own graph traversal.

They prepare a workspace or a package evidence archive so the published graph,
start, gap, hook, and ABG runtime surfaces can be used from an installed
operator boundary.

## Structural Diagram

```text
operator
  -> odd-sdlc-ts install --target <workspace>
    -> install adapter
      -> package binding: pack/extract @odd-sdlc/typescript-tenant
      -> command binding: odd-sdlc-ts
      -> ABG TypeScript public installer from pinned release package
      -> manifests + bootstrap guide + normalization projection

operator
  -> odd-sdlc-ts release-cut --archive-root <dir>
    -> release adapter
      -> package binding: npm pack
      -> binary-binding proof
      -> release manifest + postmortem

operator
  -> odd-sdlc-ts release-snapshot --release-identity <version> --snapshot-root <dir>
    -> release-snapshot adapter
      -> semantic build
      -> npm pack --json
      -> consumed ABG release-snapshot admission
      -> versioned snapshot manifest + checksums

operator
  -> odd-sdlc-ts start/gaps/query-domain
    -> existing public graph/query/start adapters
    -> GTL/ABG traversal authority
```

## Module Responsibilities

### `package_binding`

Owns Node package mechanics:

- read package identity
- run `npm pack`
- extract a package tarball into `node_modules`
- link package dependencies from the source package context
- bind package binaries into `node_modules/.bin`

This module is an effect boundary. It has no SDLC domain semantics and no graph
traversal authority.

### `install`

Owns the `odd_sdlc.TS` install request:

- admit target root, package source, ABG package source, and installed package
  name
- prefer the package-local ABIogenesis dependency installed from a release
  snapshot before any sibling source checkout
- pass ABIogenesis docs and shared standards roots explicitly when consuming a
  package-local ABG release so `odd_sdlc/docs` cannot become substrate docs by
  upward-directory accident
- install the TypeScript tenant package into the target workspace
- invoke the public ABIogenesis TypeScript installer
- write the TypeScript install manifest
- write a normalization projection
- write bootstrap command guidance
- inject marker-governed `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` instruction sections for
  cold-agent `gaps` and `start` operation
- embed STDO bootstrap provenance for cold-agent ticket execution, including
  accepted aliases, method expansion, STDO-UX UI/operator-surface application,
  and first-missing-layer triage

It does not overwrite project-owned specification truth.

It does not select next traversal, retry work, or close gaps.

### `release`

Owns package release-cut and release-snapshot evidence:

- pack the TypeScript tenant package
- prove that `odd-sdlc-ts` is declared and materialized
- write a release-cut manifest and postmortem
- write ABIogenesis-style versioned release snapshots under
  `release_snapshots/odd-sdlc-typescript-tenant/<release>/`
- fail closed when the package dependency is not pinned to a versioned
  ABIogenesis release snapshot tarball
- write `release-snapshot-manifest.json`, optional `release-note.md`, and
  `checksums.sha256`
- record the consumed ABG package version, release snapshot manifest, tarball
  path, tarball digest, source ref, and source commit

Historical TypeScript release-cut archives are not a second active release
surface. They are migrated under
`release_snapshots/odd-sdlc-typescript-tenant/<legacy-release-id>/` with a
legacy release-snapshot manifest, release note, package tarball, checksums, and
preserved proof artifacts. Because those old release-cut manifests did not
record ABG substrate pins, they are historical evidence only; new release
closure must use `odd-sdlc-ts release-snapshot`.

It does not claim live worker proof or installed-workspace convergence.

### `cli`

Owns command adaptation only.

`install` and `release-cut` are async side-effect commands. Existing
`catalog`, `query-domain`, `gaps`, `start`, and `rc-report` remain bounded
read/start adapters.

## IACS

### Input

- `InstallTargetRoot`: absolute or cwd-resolved target workspace path
- `PackageSourceRoot`: absolute or cwd-resolved `odd_sdlc.TS` package root
- `AbgPackageSourceRoot`: absolute or cwd-resolved ABIogenesis TypeScript
  package root
- `AbgStandardsSourceRoot`: optional absolute or cwd-resolved shared standards
  root supplied to the ABG installer
- `AbgDocsSourceRoot`: optional absolute or cwd-resolved ABIogenesis docs root
  supplied to the ABG installer
- `ReleaseArchiveRoot`: absolute or cwd-resolved archive path
- `ReleaseSnapshotRoot`: absolute or cwd-resolved immutable snapshot path
- `ReleaseIdentity`: package version being snapshotted

### Authority

- `odd_sdlc.TS` owns package install, bootstrap guidance, and domain command
  binding.
- ABIogenesis owns runtime installation, runtime identity, command bootstrap,
  and substrate events.
- Project specification remains project-owned `WHAT`.
- GTL/ABG remains traversal and continuation authority.
- STDO bootstrap provenance is installed-product guidance over the shared
  method stack. It does not replace upstream method law, but it must be present
  in generated cold-agent surfaces so session memory is not required.

### Carrier

- `OddSdlcTypescriptInstallRequest`
- `OddSdlcTypescriptInstallManifest`
- `OddSdlcInstructionFileWrite`
- `OddSdlcBootstrapGovernance`
- `OddSdlcTypescriptReleaseCutManifest`
- `OddSdlcTypescriptReleaseSnapshotManifest`
- `OddSdlcTypescriptReleaseSnapshotAbgSubstrate`
- `NodePackageIdentity`
- `InstalledNodePackage`

### Storage

The install adapter writes:

- `.abiogenesis/odd_sdlc/typescript/install-manifest.json`
- `.abiogenesis/odd_sdlc/typescript/package-pack/`
- `.abiogenesis/odd_sdlc/typescript/package-extract/`
- `.ai-workspace/runtime/odd_sdlc-typescript-installation.json`
- `.ai-workspace/context/odd_sdlc_typescript_bootstrap.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`

The installed payload follows `.abiogenesis/<product>/<build_tenant>/...`.
`odd_sdlc.TS` therefore uses `.abiogenesis/odd_sdlc/typescript/...` and does
not create a peer `.odd_sdlc/` root.

The release adapter writes:

- `release-cut-manifest.json`
- `release-cut-postmortem.md`
- package tarball under the archive root

The release-snapshot adapter writes:

- `release_snapshots/odd-sdlc-typescript-tenant/<release>/odd-sdlc-typescript-tenant-<release>.tgz`
- `release_snapshots/odd-sdlc-typescript-tenant/<release>/release-snapshot-manifest.json`
- `release_snapshots/odd-sdlc-typescript-tenant/<release>/release-note.md` when supplied
- `release_snapshots/odd-sdlc-typescript-tenant/<release>/checksums.sha256`

The repository root also contains migrated legacy snapshots at the same package
root. Their `release-snapshot-manifest.json` kind is
`odd_sdlc_legacy_release_snapshot_manifest` so consumers do not mistake old
release-cut evidence for a new ABG-pinned release candidate.

The TypeScript package dependency for ABIogenesis is release-pinned:

```text
@abiogenesis/typescript-tenant -> file:../../../abiogenesis/release_snapshots/abiogenesis-typescript-tenant/3.8.0-rc.3/abiogenesis-typescript-tenant-3.8.0-rc.3.tgz
```

## Design Module Review

- Authority seam closure: package/install/release effects are isolated from
  graph traversal and ABG runtime truth.
- Projection-source coherence: install and release projections derive from
  package identity, materialized command paths, and ABG public installer output.
- Prime module shape: package mechanics are separated from SDLC install meaning
  and from release evidence.
- ODD alignment: side-effect adapters publish installation and release
  evidence; they do not become graph programs or continuation controllers.
- Cold-agent operation: install is complete only when target-root instruction
  files tell a fresh agent that `gaps` and `start` map to installed
  `odd-sdlc-ts` commands, that STDO aliases expand to the four governing
  methods, and that ticket execution starts with first-missing-layer triage.
- STDO-UX: when the active ticket is about UI/operator experience, the
  installer bootstrap must preserve the agentic-coder CLI as an operator UI
  binding over installed product truth, not as a rival runtime or hidden worker
  controller.

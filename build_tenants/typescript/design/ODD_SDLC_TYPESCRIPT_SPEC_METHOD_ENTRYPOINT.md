## Purpose

Define the single TypeScript operator entrypoint under Spec Method discipline.

The entrypoint admits method command intent and calls the installed
ABG/odd_sdlc contract. It is not a CLI controller, retry controller, traversal
controller, or compatibility facade. The executable process binding is only a
launch mechanism for the same method entrypoint.

## IACS

| Carrier | Owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OddSdlcSpecMethodRequest` | `spec_method/entry.ts` | admitted method command intent and options |
| `OddSdlcSpecMethodResult` | `spec_method/entry.ts` | closed method result projection |
| workspace source snapshots | `spec_method/entry.ts` | read-only filesystem admission into `deriveSdlcSourceInput` |
| project constraints fallback | `spec_method/entry.ts` | admission default when imported workspace has no project constraints file |
| graph catalog | `graph/` | entrypoint reads only |
| query-domain projection | `projection/` | entrypoint reads only |
| public start outcome | `start/` | entrypoint reads only |
| installed operator start | `operator/installed_operator.ts` | ABG-owned traversal and retry/reentry boundary |
| RC qualification report | `qualification/` | entrypoint reads only |

## Structural Carrier Diagram

```text
operator intent
  -> spec_method/entry.ts
      -> workspace source snapshots
      -> workspace/deriveSdlcWorkspaceIngressReport
      -> graph/constructSdlcGtlModule
      -> projection/projectSdlcQueryDomain
      -> start/publicStartOnce
      -> operator/executeInstalledOperatorStartWithReentry
      -> projection/deriveSdlcGapDossier
      -> qualification/describeOddSdlcTypescriptRcQualification
  -> OddSdlcSpecMethodResult
```

The shell binary `odd-sdlc-ts` may call this entrypoint, but it does not define
command law and does not export a separate CLI command module.

## Module Shape

| Module | Classification | Owns | Does Not Own |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `spec_method/entry.ts` | Spec Method entrypoint | method intent admission, read-only workspace source discovery, dispatch to graph/query/start/operator/release/install surfaces | graph truth, vector advancement, retry budget, closure fold, repair policy |
| `cli/main.ts` | Process launcher | argv/stdout/stderr/exit binding | command semantics, retry/reentry, traversal law |
| `operator/installed_operator.ts` | Installed ABG boundary | installed start execution, ABG plugin dispatch, typed retry/reentry projection, archives | user-interface grammar |

## Commands

`catalog` returns the declared TypeScript graph-function catalog.

`query-domain` reads workspace authority surfaces, derives ingress, constructs
the TypeScript GTL module, and projects the query domain.

`gaps` derives a read-only gap dossier from ABG replay/start truth. It does not
choose traversal.

`start` admits the public start contract first. If no worker transport is
provided for `F_P`, the command returns the typed worker-unattached block. If a
worker is attached, the entrypoint calls the installed operator boundary. The
installed operator, not the entrypoint, owns retry/reentry control and emits
runtime/archive truth through ABG-compatible surfaces.

`install`, `release-cut`, and `rc-report` call their product-owned modules.
They do not own traversal or retry policy.

## Non-Ownership

The Spec Method entrypoint must not:

- select next vectors directly
- own ABG iteration, retry budget, vector advancement, or closure fold
- synthesize retry context
- retry worker output
- treat `repair_worker_output` as prose without a typed repair/reentry plan
- export a second CLI command module
- claim full Python operational replacement

## Accepted Proof

The prior T-058 proof is no longer sufficient as closure evidence where it
describes a public CLI adapter as the command authority. Current closure must
prove:

- `cli/command.ts` is absent
- `spec_method/entry.ts` contains no retry loop or retry context synthesis
- installed retry/reentry control is owned by `operator/installed_operator.ts`
- focused tests run and remain available for operator review before ticket
  closure

## Position

The installed TypeScript operator is a deterministic event-calculus boundary
around probabilistic worker output.

The worker may produce a probabilistic candidate surface. The operator must not
make probabilistic state decisions. It admits the candidate through deterministic
contracts, emits ABG runtime truth, and returns a projection over that truth.

The governing type is:

```text
transition : State x Input -> TransitionResult
```

The function is total. Every observed input at every state returns one typed
result:

```text
Advanced | OpenedGap | RequiresReprice | RequiresHuman | Blocked
```

No state transition may be represented only by archive files, next-action prose,
operator memory, or a manual rerun convention.

## Authority Split

ABG owns:

- execution basis
- graph call, frame, vector, retry, continuation, terminal, and assessment
  event truth
- replay projection
- retry attempt counting
- same-edge retry eligibility
- convergence projection

`odd_sdlc.TS` owns:

- graph-function domain meaning
- worker handoff manifest contract
- product materialization contract
- worker result report admission
- deterministic postflight classification
- gap dossier content
- domain projection and operator summary

The domain may classify a failed candidate. It must return that classification
to ABG-compatible event truth before any retry, repair, repricing, human, or
terminal result is claimed.

## IACS

| Carrier | Boundary | Authority | Admission | Inadmissible Shortcut |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SdlcWorkerHandoffManifest` | worker dispatch | graph edge handoff | derived from ABG execution basis, hook contract, conformed project profile, and replay retry context | prompt-only work instruction |
| `SdlcTraversalStrategyPlan` | traversal modulation | one authoritative per-edge strategy surface | consumed by GTL/vector declarations and installed operator handoff from the same resolved plan | duplicated full-breadth or steel-thread edge lists in separate modules |
| `SdlcTraversalStrategyDecision` | current edge strategy | selected strategy for this edge | ABG-selected strategy wins; odd_sdlc fallback is used only when ABG provides no strategy | retry context overriding an explicit ABG-selected strategy |
| `SdlcFeatureScope` | feature-scope pressure | non-narrowing full-breadth or scoped steel-thread/targeted-repair pressure | derived from the strategy decision and archived in the handoff | full-breadth induction filtered to one module |
| `SdlcWorkerRetryContext` | same-edge re-entry | replay-derived prior failure state | derived from ABG retry projection and admitted gap dossiers | local attempt counter |
| `SdlcProductMaterializationContract` | product file output | tenant-root materialization law | declares tenant root, selected output root, required roles, and `relativePathBasis=tenant_root` | path convention inferred by worker |
| `SdlcWorkerResultReport` | worker admission envelope and archive projection | non-authoritative projection over typed F_P stage carriers | closed JSON report with output digest, materialized file inventory, `projectionRole: typed_fp_stage_projection`, and a same-archive `authoritativeStageResultRef` to `fp_evaluate_result.json` | prose scrape, stdout inference, or compatibility report without typed-stage citation |
| `SdlcPostflightResult` | deterministic admission | F_D postflight verdict | output, digest, unresolved reasons, materialization, and evidence checks | accepting generated files because they exist |
| `SdlcPostflightGapDossier` | failure classification | odd_sdlc domain gap meaning | derives from postflight verdict, worker report, materialization contract, and evidence refs | flat blocking-reason string as repair contract |
| `SdlcAssuranceLedger` | assurance dimension | admitted evaluator/product-domain fold truth | deterministic ledger projection over admitted materialization facts, selected evaluator rows, obligation carry, requirement fulfillment, ambiguity, capability, or shallow-realization pressure | hidden evaluator branch, F_D semantic-row synthesis, or prose-only assessment |
| `TraversalRequirementSatisfaction` | total-transition input | folded SDLC domain closure truth | deterministic fold over required assurance ledgers and selected evaluator facts | closing from one green artifact, archive-only note, or locally inferred semantic row |
| `RuntimeEvent[]` | traversal truth | ABG event calculus | `vector_evaluated`, `retry_repair_planned`, `retry_attempt_opened`, optional continuation events, or `assessed` | archive-only status |
| `GtlConsequenceProjectionRef` | ABG transition projection | ABG-owned traversal transition truth | references ABG terminal, runtime continuation transition, and admitted SDLC consequence candidate refs | local installed start outcome as convergence authority |

## Traversal Strategy Law

The traversal strategy plan is a carrier, not a convenience map. GTL/vector
modulation and operator handoff must consume the same resolved plan surface. A
separate `FULL_BREADTH_TRAVERSAL_NAMES` set in graph construction and a separate
operator fallback map are competing truth surfaces.

ABG-selected strategy is authoritative when present. odd_sdlc may apply its
source-owned fallback plan only when ABG has not supplied a strategy directive.
Retry pressure may select `targeted_repair` only through ABG-visible reentry
truth, or as fallback repair policy when no ABG-selected strategy exists.

Full-breadth edges may still project a `SdlcFeatureScope` carrier with
`mode: full_breadth` so manifests remain uniform. That carrier is non-narrowing:
it must not filter authority refs, retrieval hints, closure obligations,
materialization, or execution shards. The strategy decision records
`featureScopeRequired: false` for full-breadth.

## Feature Scope Derivation Law

Feature scope is framework-derived authority. A worker may consume it but does
not author it for closure.

Steel-thread or targeted-repair scope must bind to selected schedule refs,
required progress artifact refs, repair/reentry refs, or other typed traversal
facts. If no selected chain can be derived, the framework must fall back to
non-narrowing full breadth or emit a typed scope-derivation defect. It must not
silently choose the first declared module as the current scope.

Scope-aware assurance should evaluate typed row/module/entity/operation
identities. Reason-string token matching is not closure law by itself; it is
admissible only as a transitional projection when deterministic tests prove that
generic in-scope reasons are not suppressed and incidental token mentions do not
leak out-of-scope blockers.

## Design-Depth Admission Law

Design-depth admission may normalize useful ambiguous candidates before strict
closure, but normalization remains generic builder behavior. Missing target
identity is not repaired by inventing placeholder module names. Tenant-specific
terms such as project module vocabulary must not be hardcoded into generic
odd_sdlc core to infer ownership.

Contradictory module/entity ownership is either rejected or emitted as typed
ambiguity pressure. A partial candidate may carry useful design facts forward,
but it must not erase identity conflicts or convert them into ordinary missing
detail.

Worker retry field sets and strict parser law must be one surface. A retry
instruction must not advertise a carrier shape that the parser will reject.

## Total Transition Slice

The first T-076 implementation slice governs the failed-postflight path:

```text
F_P.transform result
  -> worker admission envelope projected as WorkerResultReport
  -> F_P.evaluate / evaluateWorkerResultPostflight
  -> SdlcPostflightResult(blocked) + fp_evaluate_result.json
  -> SdlcPostflightGapDossier(open)
  -> AssuranceLedgerSet
  -> TraversalRequirementSatisfaction(blocked | retry_same_edge | reprice_required)
  -> ABG retry repair decision
  -> retry runtime events appended
  -> operator projection
```

The pass path remains:

```text
F_P.transform result
  -> worker admission envelope projected as WorkerResultReport
  -> F_P.evaluate / evaluateWorkerResultPostflight
  -> fp_evaluate_result.json
  -> AssuranceLedgerSet
  -> TraversalRequirementSatisfaction(close_allowed)
  -> hook admission
  -> ABG assessed events
  -> replay closes current vector
```

The failed path does not close the vector. Replay keeps the same current edge
open, records retry attempt truth, and allows the next handoff to carry the
prior gap dossier.

## Mermaid State Machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> WorkerCompleted
  WorkerCompleted --> ResultReportAdmitted: report parsed and admitted
  WorkerCompleted --> GapDossierOpened: report missing or rejected

  ResultReportAdmitted --> MaterializationObserved: files observed
  MaterializationObserved --> PostflightEvaluated: deterministic checks complete

  PostflightEvaluated --> HookAdmission: postflight passed
  HookAdmission --> RuntimeAssessed: hook postflight passed
  RuntimeAssessed --> EdgeClosedByReplay: assessed events appended
  EdgeClosedByReplay --> [*]

  PostflightEvaluated --> GapDossierOpened: postflight failed
  GapDossierOpened --> RetryDecision: gap dossier admitted
  RetryDecision --> RetryEventsAppended: retry planned
  RetryDecision --> RetryStopped: budget exhausted
  RetryEventsAppended --> SameEdgeOpenByReplay: vector remains unclosed
  SameEdgeOpenByReplay --> [*]
  RetryStopped --> [*]
```

## Functional Shape

The implementation should read as transforms over admitted truth:

```text
candidate
  |> admit result report
  |> evaluate postflight
  |> derive assurance ledgers
  |> fold traversal requirement satisfaction
  |> fold(postflightToGapAndRetry, postflightToAssessment)
  |> append events
  |> project summary
```

Effect boundaries are limited to:

- worker process invocation
- filesystem observation
- archive copies
- event-log append

The core classification remains pure:

- classify blocking reasons
- build gap dossier
- derive assurance ledgers
- fold traversal requirement satisfaction
- derive retry decision input
- construct emitted runtime events

## Construction Algebra Governance

T-102 enters at requirements because REQ-F-ODDSDLC-074 through
REQ-F-ODDSDLC-079 define the constitutional algebra. This design carries those
requirements down into the deterministic realization boundary.

The runtime fold is therefore tested as a construction algebra, not only as a
successful scenario:

- every disposition maps to one lawful next-action basis
- close plus same-vector projection normalizes away from same-edge retry and
  falls through to overlay continuation or terminal close
- repair and retry preserve same-edge continuation pressure
- output-limit worker process facts stay typed as same-edge retry or repair
  pressure
- evidence admission remains separate from closure
- live repair admission preserves current observed product bytes and digests over
  stale replay manifest bytes
- execution-result edges own execution evidence and execution-repair scoped
  tenant edits
- edge permission classes govern whether product writes are admissible
- product-materialization lineage is role-sensitive: source/test product files
  carry requirement lineage while declared auxiliary build config stays
  admissible without pretending content closure
- every published hook contract is swept to prove the transform prompt and
  construction obligations do not carry evaluator obligations, report-writing
  instructions, unresolved-reason fields, or closure work
- evaluator expectations remain carried as the post-transform evaluation
  contract, not as worker-authored transform obligations
- `fp_transform_result.json` and `fp_evaluate_result.json` are the governing
  stage carriers; `worker_result_report.json` is archived only as a
  `typed_fp_stage_projection` that points back to the authoritative stage result
- `sdlc_edge_fulfillment_ledger.json` carries `fp_evaluate_result.json` in its
  admission and predecessor refs. The transform result remains transform/output
  evidence and does not substitute for the evaluation ledger fact.

The deterministic sweep lives with the installed-operator/postflight tests so
that the STDO path stays connected: requirements define the algebra, this design
declares the realization boundary, and the TypeScript test proves the fold and
permission cases as executable governance.

## Local And Global Optimization Review

Local optimization:

- keep materialization path-basis law in `SdlcProductMaterializationContract`
- keep postflight failure classification in a gap carrier, not in
  `installed_operator.ts` prose
- keep retry context as derived replay state in the handoff manifest

Global optimization:

- use ABG retry/continuation events instead of adding an `odd_sdlc` retry event
  family
- preserve `operator_summary` as a projection only
- do not copy Python's distributed controller; preserve its capability by
  collapsing it into explicit TypeScript carriers and ABG events

## Non-Claims

This design does not claim full data_mapper RC parity. It closes the algebraic
break where failed postflight previously left event calculus. The broader
authority-to-code and code-to-test depth checks remain governed by T-066,
T-069, and the wider T-041 RC envelope. The assurance-ledger slice T-077 through
T-084 is complete as a deterministic input to this state machine; it is not a
claim that a fresh external data_mapper qualification run has reached full RC
depth.

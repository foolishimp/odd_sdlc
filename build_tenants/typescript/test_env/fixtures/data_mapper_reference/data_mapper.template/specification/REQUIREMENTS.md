- Backward operation maps children back to parent
- `backward(child_keys)` returns the unique parent key
- Multiple children map to same parent (many-to-one backward)

---

#### REQ-ADJ-08: Data Reconciliation via Adjoints

**Priority**: High
**Type**: Functional
**Traces To**: INT-005 (Adjoint Morphisms - Data Reconciliation)

**Description**: The system must support data reconciliation by computing `backward(forward(x))` and validating containment against original input `x`.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Reconciliation operation computes `backward(forward(x))` for a given input set `x`
- For isomorphisms: `backward(forward(x)) = x` (exact equality)
- For projections/lossy: `backward(forward(x)) ⊇ x` (containment validated)
- Missing records in containment are reported for investigation
- Reconciliation can run as validation step after forward execution
- Reconciliation results are exportable for audit

---

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given a subset of target records, compute contributing source records via backward
- Impact analysis traverses composed backward path `(fn ∘ ... ∘ f1)⁻ = f1⁻ ∘ ... ∘ fn⁻`
- Result includes all source entities and records on the path
- Impact analysis respects epoch/context boundaries
- Result is exportable for downstream analysis
- Performance: impact analysis should be O(|target_subset|) not O(|full_dataset|)

---

- Changes to B can be propagated to A via `backward`
- Conflict detection when both sides have changes
- Conflict resolution strategies: source-wins, target-wins, merge, fail
- Bidirectional sync respects epoch/context constraints
- Round-trip containment bounds inform conflict detection

---

**Priority**: Medium
**Type**: Non-Functional (Performance)
**Traces To**: INT-005 (Adjoint Morphisms), RIC-LIN-01 (Lineage Modes)

**Description**: Adjoint backward metadata (reverse-join tables, filtered keys) must be stored efficiently with configurable strategies.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Storage strategies: inline (with output), separate table, compressed
- Compression options: Roaring Bitmaps for key sets, range encoding for sorted keys
- Storage overhead budget configurable per job (e.g., max 20% of output size)
- Metadata can be pruned after configurable retention period
- Metadata storage is integrated with lineage mode selection
- Full lineage mode implies full adjoint metadata; sampled mode implies sampled metadata

---

### 2.8. Cross-Domain Fidelity (COV)

#### REQ-COV-01: Cross-Domain Covariance Contracts

**Priority**: High
**Type**: Functional
**Traces To**: INT-001, INT-002 (Axiom 8: Topology is the Guardrail), REQ-ADJ-01

**Description**: The system must support formal Covariance Contracts between domains, defining how entities in one domain relate to entities in another domain with explicit grain alignment requirements.

**Rationale**: Complex enterprises operate multiple data domains (Finance, Risk, Operations, Regulatory) that must maintain consistent views of the same underlying business reality. Without formal contracts, domains diverge silently, creating reconciliation nightmares and regulatory exposure.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Covariance contracts define morphisms between domains with explicit grain alignment
- Each cross-domain morphism declares cardinality (1:1, N:1, 1:N, M:N)
- Grain alignment is enforced: ATOMIC↔ATOMIC, DAILY↔DAILY, etc.
- Cross-grain mappings require explicit aggregation/disaggregation morphisms
- Contracts are versioned and immutable (REQ-TRV-05-B)
- Contract violations are detected at compile time where possible
- Contracts support invariant declarations (REQ-COV-02)

---

#### REQ-COV-02: Fidelity Invariants

**Priority**: Critical
**Type**: Functional
**Traces To**: INT-001, INT-002 (Axiom 7: Types are Contracts), REQ-COV-01

**Description**: Covariance contracts must support Fidelity Invariants - mathematical assertions that must hold between domains at each grain level, with violations treated as contract breaches, not acceptable drift.

**Rationale**: In regulated environments, "drift" is not tolerable - either the data is correct or it's a breach. Fidelity invariants provide provable guarantees that cross-domain relationships hold.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Invariants are declared per grain level (ATOMIC, DAILY, MONTHLY, etc.)
- Invariant types include:
  - **Conservation**: `sum(A.amount) == sum(B.amount)` (value preservation)
  - **Coverage**: `count(B) >= count(A)` (completeness)
  - **Alignment**: `A.as_of_date == B.as_of_date` (temporal consistency)
  - **Containment**: `keys(A) ⊆ keys(B)` (subset relationship)
- Invariants support **materiality thresholds** (immaterial differences below threshold)
- Materiality thresholds are explicit, auditable, and justified
- Invariant violations are **contract breaches**, not warnings
- Breach severity levels: IMMATERIAL (below threshold), MATERIAL (above threshold), CRITICAL (structural)
- All invariant checks are logged with full context for audit

---

#### REQ-COV-03: Fidelity Verification

**Priority**: Critical
**Type**: Functional
**Traces To**: INT-001, REQ-COV-01, REQ-COV-02, REQ-TRV-05-A

**Description**: The system must provide Fidelity Verification - the ability to prove that cross-domain invariants hold at any point in time, with cryptographic evidence binding the proof to immutable domain states.

**Rationale**: Auditors and regulators require proof, not assertions. Fidelity verification produces evidence that can be independently validated, not just logs that claim correctness.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Fidelity verification produces a **Fidelity Certificate** for each verification run
- Certificate is cryptographically bound to:
  - Source domain state (snapshot hash)
  - Target domain state (snapshot hash)
  - Contract version
  - Invariant evaluation results
  - Timestamp and run ID
- Certificate includes:
  - All invariants checked
  - Pass/fail status for each invariant
  - Actual values vs expected values
  - Materiality threshold applied
  - Any breaches detected with full context
- Certificates are immutable (stored with run manifest per REQ-TRV-05-A)
- Historical certificates are queryable for audit
- Verification can run as scheduled job or on-demand
- Verification performance: O(sample) for statistical verification, O(full) for exhaustive

---

#### REQ-COV-04: Contract Breach Detection

**Priority**: Critical
**Type**: Functional
**Traces To**: INT-001, REQ-COV-02, REQ-COV-03, REQ-TYP-03 (Error Domain)

**Description**: When fidelity verification detects invariant violations exceeding materiality thresholds, the system must treat these as Contract Breaches with full diagnostic capture and configurable response.

**Rationale**: Breaches are not errors to be logged and ignored - they represent a breakdown in the fundamental guarantee that domains are consistent. Response must be explicit and auditable.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Breach detection occurs during fidelity verification
- Breach severity classification:
  - **IMMATERIAL**: Below materiality threshold, logged but not escalated
  - **MATERIAL**: Above threshold, requires investigation and remediation
  - **CRITICAL**: Structural breach (missing entities, broken relationships), halts dependent processing
- Breach record includes:
  - Contract and invariant violated
  - Source and target entities involved
  - Expected vs actual values
  - Materiality threshold and how much exceeded
  - Contributing records (via adjoint backward traversal)
  - Timestamp and domain snapshot references
- Configurable breach response:
  - `ALERT`: Notify but continue processing
  - `QUARANTINE`: Continue but flag affected records
  - `HALT`: Stop dependent processing until remediated
  - `ROLLBACK`: Revert to last verified state
- Breach records are queryable and exportable for regulatory reporting
- Breach remediation is tracked with audit trail

---

#### REQ-COV-05: Covariant Propagation

**Priority**: High
**Type**: Functional
**Traces To**: INT-001, REQ-COV-01, REQ-ADJ-10 (Bidirectional Sync)

**Description**: Changes in one domain must propagate correctly to related domains per the covariance contract, maintaining fidelity invariants across the propagation.

**Rationale**: Domains don't exist in isolation. When Finance books a trade, Risk must see it. When Risk revalues a position, Finance must reflect it. Propagation must be automatic, correct, and verifiable.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Change propagation follows covariance contract morphisms
- Propagation respects grain alignment (atomic changes propagate to atomic, aggregate to aggregate)
- Propagation direction is explicit: FORWARD (A→B), BACKWARD (B→A), or BIDIRECTIONAL
- Conflict detection when both domains have concurrent changes to related entities
- Conflict resolution strategies per contract:
  - `SOURCE_AUTHORITATIVE`: Source domain wins
  - `TARGET_AUTHORITATIVE`: Target domain wins
  - `MERGE`: Apply non-conflicting changes from both
  - `FAIL`: Halt and require manual resolution
- Each propagation is an immutable run with full manifest (REQ-TRV-05-A)
- Fidelity verification runs automatically after propagation
- Propagation failures do not leave domains in inconsistent state (transactional semantics)

---

#### REQ-COV-06: Multi-Grain Fidelity

**Priority**: High
**Type**: Functional
**Traces To**: INT-001, REQ-COV-02, REQ-LDM-06, REQ-INT-02

**Description**: Fidelity invariants must be verifiable across grain boundaries within and between domains, ensuring that aggregations in one domain align with aggregations in another.

**Rationale**: A daily P&L in Finance must equal the sum of atomic transactions. A monthly Risk report must align with daily VaR calculations. Cross-grain fidelity prevents the "reconciliation gap" problem.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Cross-grain invariants supported within domain: `sum(daily) == monthly`
- Cross-grain invariants supported across domains: `sum(A.daily) == sum(B.daily)`
- Grain hierarchy is explicit in both domains (REQ-LDM-06)
- Aggregation morphisms between grains are monoidal (REQ-LDM-04)
- Verification traverses grain hierarchy to check consistency at each level
- Grain misalignment (e.g., comparing daily to monthly without aggregation) is rejected at compile time
- Multi-grain verification produces hierarchical fidelity certificate showing status at each level

---

#### REQ-COV-07: Contract Enforcement

**Priority**: Critical
**Type**: Functional
**Traces To**: INT-001, REQ-COV-01, REQ-COV-02, REQ-LDM-03

**Description**: Covariance contracts must be enforced at execution time, not just verified after the fact. Operations that would violate fidelity invariants must be prevented before they corrupt domain state.

**Rationale**: Verification detects problems after they occur. Enforcement prevents problems from occurring. In financial systems, it's better to reject a transaction that would break invariants than to process it and detect the breach later.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Contract enforcement occurs during mapping execution, not just verification
- **Pre-execution enforcement**: Validate that proposed changes will not violate invariants
- **Transactional enforcement**: Cross-domain updates are atomic - both succeed or both fail
- Enforcement modes per contract:
  - `STRICT`: Reject any operation that would violate invariants
  - `DEFERRED`: Allow operation but require remediation within defined window
  - `ADVISORY`: Warn but allow (for migration/transition periods only)
- Enforcement integrates with Error Domain (REQ-TYP-03) for rejected operations
- Enforcement decisions are logged with full context
- Compile-time enforcement where possible (REQ-LDM-03 path validation extended to cross-domain)
- Runtime enforcement for value-level invariants
- Enforcement cannot be bypassed without explicit override with audit trail

---

#### REQ-COV-08: Fidelity Certificate Chain

**Priority**: High
**Type**: Functional
**Traces To**: INT-001, REQ-COV-03, REQ-TRV-05-A, REQ-AI-02

**Description**: Fidelity certificates must form an immutable chain, enabling proof of continuous fidelity over time and detection of any gaps in verification coverage.

**Rationale**: A single point-in-time certificate proves fidelity at that moment. A certificate chain proves continuous fidelity and makes any verification gaps visible. This is essential for regulatory reporting that requires proof of ongoing compliance.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Each fidelity certificate references the previous certificate (hash chain)
- Certificate chain is cryptographically tamper-evident
- Gaps in verification (missed scheduled verifications) are detectable
- Chain provides:
  - Continuous fidelity proof over time period
  - List of all breaches detected and remediated
  - Verification coverage percentage
  - Time since last full verification
- Chain is queryable: "Prove fidelity between date A and date B"
- Chain supports branching (verification at different grain levels, different contracts)
- Certificate chain integrates with run manifest hierarchy (REQ-TRV-05-A)
- Export format for regulatory submission (JSON, XML, PDF with signatures)

---

### 2.9. Data Quality (DQ)

#### REQ-PDM-06: Late Arrival Handling

**Priority**: High
**Type**: Functional
**Traces To**: INT-001, INT-002 (Axiom 4: Data Has Contextual Extent)

**Description**: The system must handle late-arriving data (records that arrive after their epoch has been processed) with explicit strategies that maintain determinism and auditability.

**Rationale**: In distributed systems, data frequently arrives out of order. Without explicit late arrival handling, systems either lose data or produce non-deterministic results when re-processing.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Late arrival detection identifies records arriving after epoch closure
- Configurable strategies per source:
  - `REJECT`: Reject late records to Error Domain with `LATE_ARRIVAL` error code
  - `REPROCESS`: Trigger reprocessing of affected epoch (requires immutable inputs)
  - `ACCUMULATE`: Route to accumulation buffer for next epoch (with lineage marking)
  - `BACKFILL`: Route to separate backfill pipeline with different SLAs
- Strategy selection is explicit in PDM source configuration
- Late arrival records are never silently dropped
- Lineage captures late arrival handling decisions
- Metrics track late arrival frequency per source per epoch

---

#### REQ-DQ-01: Volume Threshold Monitoring

**Priority**: High
**Type**: Functional
**Traces To**: INT-001, REQ-TRV-06, REQ-TYP-03-A

**Description**: The system must detect anomalous data volumes (too few or too many records) against expected baselines and treat violations as potential data quality issues.

**Rationale**: Sudden drops in volume often indicate upstream failures. Sudden spikes may indicate duplicate delivery or configuration errors. Both require investigation before processing.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Volume thresholds configurable per source:
  - `min_records`: Minimum expected records (absolute or percentage of historical average)
  - `max_records`: Maximum expected records (absolute or percentage of historical average)
  - `baseline_window`: Historical window for computing baseline (e.g., 7-day rolling average)
- Threshold violations trigger configurable responses:
  - `WARN`: Log warning but continue processing
  - `HALT`: Stop processing pending investigation
  - `QUARANTINE`: Process but flag entire epoch for review
- Volume metrics captured in telemetry (REQ-TRV-04)
- Historical volume trends queryable for anomaly investigation
- Zero-record inputs are treated as threshold violations (not silently accepted)

---

#### REQ-DQ-02: Distribution Monitoring

**Priority**: Medium
**Type**: Functional
**Traces To**: INT-001, REQ-TRV-04, REQ-COV-02

**Description**: The system must monitor data distribution changes (null rates, value distributions, cardinality) against baselines to detect silent data quality degradation.

**Rationale**: Data can be structurally correct but semantically wrong. A sudden increase in null rates or change in value distribution often indicates upstream problems that type systems cannot detect.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Distribution metrics computed per configurable fields:
  - `null_rate`: Percentage of null/missing values
  - `distinct_count`: Cardinality of distinct values
  - `value_distribution`: Histogram of value ranges (numeric) or top-N frequencies (categorical)
- Baseline comparison against historical distributions:
  - `null_rate_threshold`: Maximum acceptable null rate change
  - `cardinality_threshold`: Maximum acceptable cardinality change
  - `distribution_divergence`: Statistical divergence threshold (e.g., KL divergence, chi-squared)
- Violations trigger configurable responses (WARN, HALT, QUARANTINE)
- Distribution metrics are part of telemetry output
- Distribution monitoring is opt-in per field (not automatic for all fields)

---

#### REQ-DQ-03: Custom Validation Rules

**Priority**: Medium
**Type**: Functional
**Traces To**: INT-001, REQ-TYP-02, REQ-INT-01

**Description**: The system must support user-defined validation rules that go beyond type constraints, allowing domain-specific data quality checks to be integrated into the processing pipeline.

**Rationale**: Refinement types catch value-level constraints, but many data quality rules are cross-field or context-dependent (e.g., "end_date must be after start_date", "if status='CLOSED', close_date must be present").

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Custom validation rules are definable as pure functions (REQ-INT-01)
- Rules can reference multiple fields within the same record
- Rules can reference lookup tables for domain validation
- Rule violations route to Error Domain (REQ-TYP-03) with custom error codes
- Rules are executed after type validation, before transformation
- Rules are versioned and immutable per run (REQ-TRV-05-A)
- Rule definition includes:
  - Rule ID and description
  - Validation predicate (pure function)
  - Severity (ERROR, WARNING)
  - Error message template

---

#### REQ-DQ-04: Profiling Integration

**Priority**: Low
**Type**: Non-Functional (Observability)
**Traces To**: INT-001, REQ-TRV-04, REQ-AI-03

**Description**: The system must integrate with data profiling tools to provide comprehensive data quality visibility and support dry-run validation.

**Rationale**: Data engineers need profiling for initial data understanding and ongoing quality monitoring. Integration with standard profiling output formats enables tooling ecosystem compatibility.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Profiling can run as part of dry-run mode (REQ-AI-03)
- Profiling output includes:
  - Schema inference and validation against declared types
  - Completeness metrics (null rates per field)
  - Uniqueness metrics (duplicate rates for key fields)
  - Value statistics (min, max, mean, stddev for numerics)
  - Pattern detection (for strings)
  - Referential integrity checks (foreign key validity)
- Profiling output exportable in standard formats (JSON, OpenMetadata)
- Profiling results can populate distribution baselines (REQ-DQ-02)
- Profiling is optional and configurable per source
- Profiling performance: target < 5% overhead when enabled

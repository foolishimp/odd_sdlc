# T-131 Guided odd_chat Bootstrap

This start document is the single scenario contract for the guided odd_chat live
build lane.

The product intent is to make `odd_chat` a governed CLI for people who should
not receive an unconstrained Claude/Codex shell. `odd_chat` gives them the
benefit of AI-assisted graph-function construction while keeping them inside a
loaded ODD/GTL/ABG domain, a lawful action menu, typed evidence, and human
evaluator/intent choices.

The fixture intentionally keeps the default domain small while preserving the
full lifecycle: bootstrap, sandbox setup, install odd_sdlc as builder, build
odd_chat, locally install odd_chat, test odd_chat against the default domain,
and project release readiness.
The fixture must not include prebuilt odd_chat implementation source. Each live
proof run starts from this document, creates a fresh sandbox, installs
odd_sdlc, and builds the odd_chat target files as test evidence.

## Operating Model

T-131 has two separate products in play.

1. `odd_sdlc` is the builder under test. It starts from this bootstrap document
   and builds the odd_chat CLI into the sandbox.
2. `odd_chat` is the product being built. Once built, it can create/open an
   operator workspace, load deployed ODD/GTL/ABG domains into that workspace,
   and present their lawful graph-function surface to a human operator.

odd_chat is not an odd_sdlc wrapper and odd_sdlc is not odd_chat's runtime graph
loader. odd_chat's capability is creating an operator workspace, loading a
deployed ODD/GTL/ABG domain into that workspace, and then letting the human
choose which lawful graph function to invoke. The default domain for the first
proof is `document_to_requirements`: a graph that turns a start document into a
typed requirements set.

```text
observer
  -> workspace create/open dialogue
  -> deployed domain selection
  -> evaluator projection
  -> graph-function choice
  -> human intent choice
  -> selected domain graph function
  -> edge-local asset build
  -> F_D admission and evidence
  -> next observer projection
```

The AI worker may construct only the selected edge-local asset. It must not plan
the full lifecycle, invent new graph actions, skip the human evaluator choice,
or decide release closure.

## Human Evaluator Rule

The operator chooses exactly one lawful action for the current node. The choice
is evidence, not a hidden prompt preference. Before this action choice,
odd_chat must have an active workspace and a selected graph function.

Allowed human decisions:

- `continue`: invoke the listed graph function.
- `retry`: repair the current target asset with the typed gap dossier.
- `review`: stop traversal and inspect evidence.
- `reprice`: open a ticket/change-intent route before continuing.

## Completion Definition

The fixture is complete when the odd_chat sandbox has admitted evidence for:

1. odd_sdlc installation,
2. odd_chat implementation,
3. odd_chat local CLI deployment,
4. odd_chat workspace creation/opening,
5. odd_chat graph-function selection,
6. odd_chat tests,
7. release-readiness projection over admitted evidence.
